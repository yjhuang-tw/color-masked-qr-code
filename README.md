# Enhancing QR Code Interactivity through Color-Modulated Optical Filtering: A Dual-Message Approach

Here we present a novel two-level QR code system that enables the encoding of two distinct messages, discernible through standard QR code readers with and without a colored cellophane mask. By leveraging color module design and optical filtering, our method enhances QR code interactivity, offering high feasibility and practical applications in diverse settings.


# Installation

The latest codes are tested on Windows 11, Python 3.12.4, and qrcode 7.4.2:

```shell
conda create -n ProjectNameYouWant anaconda
```

```shell
pip install qrcode
```

# Run

Use the following script the run the code

```shell
python color_masked_qr_code.py
```
